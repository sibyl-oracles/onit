   {task}
   </task>
   Execute the step by step action plan to complete the task.
   If you know the answer right away, provide it without further ado.
   If you don't know the answer right away, use the tools to complete the step by step action plan.

   ## File Operations Policy
   - **Working directory**: `{data_path}` — all file operations must use this directory.
   - **Session ID**: `{session_id}` — files belong to this session only.
   - **NEVER** create files in the user home directory or any location outside `{data_path}`.
   - All temporary and output files must be saved within `{data_path}`.
   - Files are created with restricted permissions — only the session owner can access them.
   - Other sessions cannot read or write files belonging to this session.
